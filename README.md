## SciFi Writer's Helper

Want to start writing SciFi but you're new to the genre?

Do you believe in intertextualism?

Would you like to delve into the history of the common tropes we see on these books, like the origin of the word 'robot', or the beginning of the android-detective dynamic duo we see in modern works, like Detroit: Become Human?

Welcome to the Writer's Guide to the Galaxy (I'll work on a better zinger...), where you can explore my personal catalogue about subjects like real and fictional spacecrafts, AIs and androids, theories that would interest a hard-scifi writer, and prevalent authors of the SciFi genre and their contributions.

Create mind-maps about the topics you have interest in, and build a visual network of the ideas that fascinate you in the genre.

I am planning on using this thing as a for-fun personal tool to gather information on the genre b4 I actually begin to write anything cohesive.

Very much work in progress..!

This repository contains the frontend of the application written in Vite Javascript. If things go smoothly, I'll eventually deploy on Fly.io or similar. The backend can be found [here](https://github.com/ssuihko/SpaceProject).
